                <p><i class="fa fa-quote-left"></i> We had Fang come in and help us get an admin portal up and running so we could more easily manage our system. He immediately started contributing and he obviously knew what he was doing when it
                    came to <em>AngularJs</em>. He also helped us <strong>improve our existing libraries</strong> and wasn't afraid to give us pointers on how they could be improved -- a very good quality in a programmer. He has given us a very
                    good foundation to build our application on going forward and we appreciate his hard work. </p>

                <p> <i class="fa fa-quote-left"></i> I found Fang Jin on-line; I was looking for a web developer to help me launch a newer version of my website. I arranged a meeting with Fang and found him to be very knowledgeable and helpful. It
                    was important to me that I could participate, going forward, in continued web improvements. After discussions with Fang, he convinced me of an alternative development strategy and now, in hind-site, that was absolutely the
                    right call.&nbsp;Fang has a <strong>deep understand of web development and execution</strong> and was a quick study when it came time to integrate another vendor's application. In just a matter of weeks, I was up and running
                    with my new site. Great communication and solid integrity.&nbsp; </p>

                <p><i class="fa fa-quote-left"></i> Fang is an excellence back-end developer with front-end development skills. He is always willing to learn and take on new technologies. He is very easy to work with and dedicated. While working
                    with Fang I noticed that he was interested in <strong>using new technologies to make development faster and easier for the whole team</strong>. Fang is a leader in identifying road blocks in the development process and usability.
                    He diligently looks for solutions and will create terrific documentation to lead forward with a new project/concept that includes new coding methods/standards to make the development process easier for the whole team. Fang
                    would develop prototypes of concepts for charts for outputting and organizing data in a creative way based on Designs. I would highly recommend working with Fang in the future. </p>

                <p><i class="fa fa-quote-left"></i> At Duke, I worked with Fang on a couple of projects. During each project, not only did he demonstrate exceptional knowledge of the tools at hand, but he also exhibited a <strong>deep understanding of the requirements and challenges that he faced</strong>.
                    He is incredibly talented when it comes to any aspect of a project: interpreting the needs of the client; suggesting ideas for implementation; providing quick turnaround time; etc...&nbsp;Fang also showed great excitement and
                    interest for technology outside the scope of the project. He was always eager to show off or talk about some new demo he had been working&nbsp;on in his spare time. I always looked forward to hearing him talk about his newest
                    interest.&nbsp;Fang is very personable and quite knowledgeable on all aspects of technology, whether it be front-end design, programming or server configuration/setup. It was a real pleasure working with him.&nbsp; </p>

                <p><i class="fa fa-quote-left"></i> Fang volunteered for the International Center for Disaster Recovery during September and October 2014. He helped us begin to <strong>move our proof of concept for RecoveryHub (using <em>Drupal</em> Commons 3.0) toward a robust, deployable solution</strong>.
                    Fang created a framework for us using Drupal's Features that will allow us to modify and enhance our site in the future more easily. He quickly learned technologies that we were using such as Apache Solr. One of the things
                    that we appreciated about Fang is that he always took a "big picture" view of our project and advised us on different options to take, rather than simply proceed without asking questions. He thoroughly explained the pros and
                    cons of each option, making him a trusted team member and adviser. Fang will be well suited for future senior architect or developer roles.&nbsp; </p>
