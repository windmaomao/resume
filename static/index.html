                            He diligently looks for solutions and will create terrific documentation to lead forward with a new project/concept that includes new coding methods/standards to make the development process easier for the whole team. Fang

                            He is incredibly talented when it comes to any aspect of a project: interpreting the needs of the client; suggesting ideas for implementation; providing quick turnaround time; etc...&nbsp;Fang also showed great excitement and
                            interest for technology outside the scope of the project. He was always eager to show off or talk about some new demo he had been working&nbsp;on in his spare time. I always looked forward to hearing him talk about his newest

                            Fang created a framework for us using Drupal's Features that will allow us to modify and enhance our site in the future more easily. He quickly learned technologies that we were using such as Apache Solr. One of the things
                            that we appreciated about Fang is that he always took a "big picture" view of our project and advised us on different options to take, rather than simply proceed without asking questions. He thoroughly explained the pros and
                            cons of each option, making him a trusted team member and adviser. Fang will be well suited for future senior architect or developer roles.&nbsp; </p>

                    <p>One of the challenge of cancer cell modeling is to visualize the vivid form formation and migration in realtime in 3D. I was fascinated on the visualization schema, and afterwards, the work is published as the front cover picture of
