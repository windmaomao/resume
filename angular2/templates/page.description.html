            <p>This is when I got chance with the advanced mathematic model. My job was to model water droplet dripping from the bathroom facet. Of course this was for NASA sponsored project, so this bathroom was on the moon with relatively smaller
                gravity ;) And later I took another project of modeling cancer cell migration inside human body.</p>

            <p>One of the challenge of cancer cell modeling is to visualize the vivid form formation and migration in realtime in 3D. I was fascinated on the visualization schema, and afterwards, the work is published as the front cover picture of
                Journal of Nonlinearity. You might be able to find this online. </p>

            <p>I taught three semesters advanced college math class at UC Irvine when I took post doc there. The teaching experience taught me teaching and learning are two different aspects of life, both are art on itself. </p>
