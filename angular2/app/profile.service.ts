Fang is a leader in identifying road blocks in the development process and usability. He diligently looks for solutions and will create terrific documentation to lead forward with a new project/concept that includes new coding methods/standards to make the would develop prototypes of concepts for charts for outputting and organizing data in a creative way based on Designs.

He is incredibly talented when it comes to any aspect of a project: interpreting the needs of the client; suggesting ideas for implementation; providing quick turnaround time; etc... Fang also showed great excitement and interest for technology outside the scope of the project. He was always eager to show off or talk about some new demo he had been working&nbsp;on in his spare time. I always looked forward to hearing him talk about his newest interest. Fang is very personable and quite knowledgeable on all aspects of technology, whether it be front-end design, programming or server configuration/setup. It was a real pleasure working with him. ",

Fang created a framework for us using Drupal's Features that will allow us to modify and enhance our site in the future more easily. He quickly learned technologies that we were using such as Apache Solr. One of the things that we appreciated about Fang is that he always took a \"big picture\" view of our project and advised us on different options to take, rather than simply proceed without asking questions. He thoroughly explained the pros and cons of each option, making him a trusted team member and adviser. Fang will be well suited for future senior architect or developer roles.",
