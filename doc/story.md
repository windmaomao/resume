#### Allow update resume
As the resume creator, I would like read my resume and keep it updated with recent changes, ex. title, contact and professional description. I would also be able to add/update work experience over the years, including company, work description, and duration. For each company, it would be better if I could further add/update project description, duration and highlights.

#### Support static content
As a content provider and designer, I would like to provide most of content in static version. In design stage this would provide a real working resume. In production, this would provide a fall-back option in case internet connection is not available.

#### Support local content
As a recruit agent or employer who would like to check out the resume, it would be easy if the site doesn't rely on the internet connection all the time, so that most of time they can just enjoy the local version of the resume.
